		<p>Sullivan is a rural town in Missouri with a population of just under 6,000. I lived here up until 18, when I moved away to college. I enjoyed living in a small peaceful town but also vowed never to move back there.</p>
        <h5>Things to do in Sullivan:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Drive a truck</li>
            <li>Shoot things</li>

        <p>St. Louis has been my home a couple different times. I lived here while attending college and moved back here a couple years ago. </p>

        <p>Springfield is the capital of Illinois and a decent size city surrounded by rural farming communities. I lived here twice and both times were disappointing.</p>

        <img src="http://www.riverfrontterrace.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/phoenix-park-2.jpg" alt="Eau Claire" />
        <p>Eau Claire is a small city, about 70,000 people, a couple hours east of Minneapolis. It's somewhat a college town and has beautiful scenery. I lived here during their worst winter in 30 years so I didn't have a lot of time to enjoy said scenery. </p>
        <h5>Things to do in Eau Claire:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Shovel snow</li>
            <li>Pray for no snow</li>
        <ul>
